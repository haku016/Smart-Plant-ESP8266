# Smart-Plant-ESP8266
In this project I use ESP8266 as a processor to execute all the function in my Smart Plant system.
For sensors part I use 2 small sensor: YL-69 for measuring soil moisture, DS18b20 for the temperature.
Relying on an exsisting platform, I use Blynk as my user interface and cloud to mannually control the system.
